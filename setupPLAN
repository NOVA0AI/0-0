Since you’ve indicated "ready," I’ll provide the third output for the Nova project: a **detailed action plan with 20 line items** outlining the first steps to achieve the key objectives and milestones. This action plan is designed to fit within the one-week sprint (February 20–26, 2025), breaking down the work into specific, actionable tasks. It aligns with Nova’s vision of scalability, automation, and type-only interaction, ensuring a clear path from start to public launch.

## Detailed Action Plan for Nova (20 Line Items)

Below is a sequential list of 20 specific tasks to kick off the Nova project. Each task includes a description, the day it’s assigned to, and its purpose, ensuring steady progress toward the milestones outlined earlier.

### Day 1: Project Setup and Structure (February 20, 2025)
1. **Initialize GitHub Repository**  
   - *Description*: Create a public GitHub repository named "Nova" with a README, license (MIT), and .gitignore file.  
   - *Purpose*: Establishes Nova as an open-source project and provides a central hub for collaboration.

2. **Define Project Directory Structure**  
   - *Description*: Set up directories for core components (e.g., `/orchestrator`, `/toolbox`, `/agents`, `/commands`) and add placeholder files.  
   - *Purpose*: Creates a scalable foundation for organized development.

3. **Install Initial Dependencies**  
   - *Description*: Set up a package manager (e.g., npm or pip) and install basic libraries for the chosen language (e.g., Python or Node.js).  
   - *Purpose*: Prepares the environment for coding and testing.

### Day 2: Master Orchestrator Implementation (February 21, 2025)
4. **Design Master Orchestrator Interface**  
   - *Description*: Define the input/output structure for the master orchestrator, focusing on type-only command processing.  
   - *Purpose*: Sets the blueprint for the system’s central coordinator.

5. **Implement Basic Orchestrator Logic**  
   - *Description*: Code the master orchestrator to accept simple typed commands (e.g., "start", "status") and log them.  
   - *Purpose*: Establishes the orchestrator as functional, even at a basic level.

6. **Push Orchestrator to GitHub**  
   - *Description*: Commit and push the initial orchestrator code with a clear commit message.  
   - *Purpose*: Ensures version control and transparency for contributors.

### Day 3: Shared Agentic Toolbox and Guidelines (February 22, 2025)
7. **Create Shared Agentic Toolbox File**  
   - *Description*: Set up a JSON or YAML file for the Shared Agentic Toolbox to store system guidelines and rules.  
   - *Purpose*: Centralizes rules for consistent agent behavior.

8. **Write Initial Guidelines**  
   - *Description*: Add basic rules to the toolbox (e.g., "prioritize scalability", "log all commands").  
   - *Purpose*: Provides agents with operational clarity from the start.

9. **Integrate Toolbox with Orchestrator**  
   - *Description*: Update the orchestrator to read and apply guidelines from the toolbox.  
   - *Purpose*: Ensures the orchestrator follows centralized rules.

### Day 4: Passive Listener Agent (February 23, 2025)
10. **Design Passive Listener Interface**  
    - *Description*: Define how the Passive Listener Agent will monitor typed inputs and update system context.  
    - *Purpose*: Prepares for real-time user alignment.

11. **Implement Passive Listener**  
    - *Description*: Code the agent to log user commands and update a context file (e.g., `context.json`).  
    - *Purpose*: Keeps the system in sync with user intent.

12. **Test Listener with Orchestrator**  
    - *Description*: Run a test where the orchestrator processes a command flagged by the listener.  
    - *Purpose*: Verifies integration between components.

### Day 5: Type-Only Interaction and Command Parsing (February 24, 2025)
13. **Design Command Interpreter**  
    - *Description*: Define a syntax for typed commands (e.g., `action:parameter`) and parsing rules.  
    - *Purpose*: Standardizes user interaction.

14. **Implement Command Parsing**  
    - *Description*: Code the interpreter to parse commands and route them to the orchestrator.  
    - *Purpose*: Enables full type-only interaction.

15. **Test End-to-End Command Flow**  
    - *Description*: Test a sequence of commands (e.g., "start:task1", "status") from input to execution.  
    - *Purpose*: Confirms the interaction model works seamlessly.

### Day 6: Initial Self-Optimization Mechanisms (February 25, 2025)
16. **Add Performance Logging**  
    - *Description*: Implement logging of execution times and resource usage for commands.  
    - *Purpose*: Provides data for self-optimization.

17. **Create Basic Optimization Rule**  
    - *Description*: Code a simple rule (e.g., "if command X takes >2s, flag for review") in the orchestrator.  
    - *Purpose*: Introduces self-improvement capability.

18. **Test Optimization Feedback**  
    - *Description*: Simulate slow commands and verify the system logs and flags them.  
    - *Purpose*: Ensures the optimization mechanism functions.

### Day 7: Final Testing and GitHub Launch (February 26, 2025)
19. **Conduct Full System Test**  
    - *Description*: Run a comprehensive test of all components (orchestrator, listener, interpreter) with sample commands.  
    - *Purpose*: Identifies and fixes bugs before launch.

20. **Polish and Launch on GitHub**  
    - *Description*: Update README with setup instructions, finalize documentation, and announce the release in a GitHub issue.  
    - *Purpose*: Makes Nova publicly accessible and ready for community contributions.

## Why This Action Plan?
- **Daily Progress**: Tasks are spread across the week, aligning with the one-week sprint and hitting each milestone.
- **Scalability**: Early setup (e.g., directory structure, toolbox) ensures the system can grow without chaos.
- **Automation**: By Day 5, the system executes commands automatically, reducing manual effort.
- **Type-Only Interaction**: Fully implemented by Day 5, meeting the core user experience goal.
- **Mitigation**: Testing and integration steps (e.g., #12, #15, #19) catch issues early.

This action plan provides a clear, step-by-step roadmap to bring Nova from concept to launch in one week. Let me know if you’d like adjustments or additional details!
