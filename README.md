Nova is an open-source project aimed at creating a **self-optimizing, scalable AI chat hub**. It leverages a network of specialized agents to handle tasks ranging from dependency mapping to evolutionary tracking, all while maintaining a **type-only interaction model** for users. Designed to start small and scale massively, Nova aspires to support billions of users and manage petabytes of data. With a philosophy of **over-designing for future-proofing**, the system ensures readiness for expansion or pivots without requiring major refactoring.

## Project Vision
Nova envisions a future where AI systems are not only intelligent but also self-sustaining. The platform aims to:
- **Learn from every interaction** to enhance its responses and capabilities.
- **Optimize its own performance** through automated monitoring and adjustments.
- **Scale effortlessly** to meet global demand with a modular, extensible architecture.
- **Operate with minimal manual intervention**, relying on a type-only interaction model where users simply type commands, and the system manages everything else.

The ultimate goal is to build an AI chat hub that evolves into a self-governing, community-driven platform, powered by open-source contributions.

## Key Features
- **Type-Only Interaction**: Users engage with the system исключительно through typed commands.
- **Self-Optimization**: The system continuously improves based on usage patterns and performance metrics.
- **Scalability**: Engineered to grow from a single user to billions without structural changes.
- **Automation**: Automated updates, deployments, and scaling minimize manual oversight.
- **Agent Network**: Specialized agents (e.g., Dependency Mapping, Evolutionary Tracking) ensure system coherence and innovation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To set up Nova locally, ensure you have the following:
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Git**  
- **VS Code** (optional but recommended for development)

### Installation
Follow these steps to get Nova running on your machine:
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Nova.git
   cd Nova
   ```
2. **Run the Setup Script**:  
   - On Windows (PowerShell):  
     ```powershell
     .\setup.ps1
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:  
     ```bash
     ./setup.sh
     ```
   This script initializes the project structure, creates placeholder files, and sets up a virtual environment.

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:  
   - Windows:  
     ```powershell
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```
   - macOS/Linux:  
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies** (if applicable):  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Commands
Nova employs a type-only interaction model. Here are some basic commands to begin:
- **`start:task1`**: Initiates a new task (e.g., "task1").
- **`status`**: Displays the current system status.
- **`help`**: Lists available commands and their descriptions.

### Advanced Interaction
- **Custom Commands**: Add your own commands by editing `/Project_Management/Command_Interpreter/command_parser.py`.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: The Passive Listener Agent adjusts responses based on the current context.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:
- **`/Constitution/`**: Core principles and guidelines.
- **`/Orchestrator/`**: Central coordination scripts.
- **`/Shared_Agentic_Toolbox/`**: Shared guidelines and context files.
- **`/Agents/`**: Specialized agents (e.g., Dependency Mapping, Evolutionary Tracking).
- **`/Passive_Listener/`**: Monitors user actions and updates context.
- **`/Project_Management/`**: Command parsing and interaction scripts.
- **`/Data/`**: Data management and infrastructure.
- **`/Model/`**: AI models and self-learning mechanisms.
- **`/Deployment/`**: Deployment and server tools.
- **`/Monitoring/`**: System monitoring and dashboards.
- **`/Documentation/`**: Project guides and capability gaps.
- **`/Backups/`**: Backup storage.

For a detailed overview, refer to the [Project Structure Guide](docs/project_structure.md).

## Agents Overview
Nova’s functionality is driven by a network of specialized agents:
- **Dependency Mapping Agent**: Tracks and manages dependencies between components.
- **Recursive Memory Cleaning Agent**: Optimizes memory usage.
- **SIKTYK Agent**: Ensures mutual understanding across the system.
- **Auditing Agents**: A suite of agents for system auditing.
- **Evolutionary Tracking Agent**: Monitors agent evolution and prevents runaway behaviors.
- **Bio Systems Agent**: Analyzes agent network behavior against biological systems, identifying innovations and gaps.
